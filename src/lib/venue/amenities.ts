// Kept apart from VenueFacts on purpose. `VenueFacts` is inference: Gemini
// reading a venue's own pages and reporting what it thinks it found, right
// most of the time and sparse where a venue is vague. This file is fact —
// Google's structured answers, the same ones shown on a Maps listing. The UI
// can say which is which, and a model can never overwrite the hard data.
//
// These fields cost nothing extra. Google bills a Places request at the
// highest SKU tier in its field mask, and `editorialSummary` — which the
// search already requests so a discovery card needs no Details call — puts
// every search on Text Search Enterprise + Atmosphere. parkingOptions,
// goodForChildren and allowsDogs are in that same tier; accessibilityOptions
// is in the cheaper Pro tier. We were paying for all of it and reading none.
